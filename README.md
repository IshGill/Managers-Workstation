# About
Having previously worked in a commercial, managerial role for a number of years, before moving into software engineering. I was interested in developing a program that could help managers store all of their employee's information in one simple, easy to use program. 

# Functions
## Add employee information easily
Very simple and easy to use, enter the employee information according to the list boxes. Note that the employee personal IRD number and Tax code are needed.
## Calculate PAYE
The Managers Workstation program can accurately calculate all employee PAYE details, from tax to KiwiSaver to ACC deductions.
## Printable Employee Records
Easily print out the employee's records by simply entering the data and hitting print!
