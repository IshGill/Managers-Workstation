# Managers Workstation
Having previously worked in a commercial business managerial role for a number of years, before moving into software engineering. I was interested in developing a program that could help managers or small business owners store all of their employee information in one simple, easy to use program.

# Functions
## Add employee information easily
Very simple and easy to use, enter the employee information according to the list boxes. Note that the employee personal IRD number and Tax code are required. Once entered, all information is stored on the Managers Workstation database and can then be searched for, updated or deleted. 
## Calculate PAYE
The Managers Workstation program can accurately calculate employee PAYE information, such as Tax, KiwiSaver, Student Loan and ACC deductions. 
## Printable Employee Records
Print out employee payslips and records by manually entering employee information or searching for employeeâ€™s record.
